# 3D Housing


## Description
This project is part of the 
[Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) 
program. The task here is to build a solution
with the data of LIDAR PLANES, active in the Geospatial industry 
to model a house in 3D with only a home address.

## Objectives

Consolidate the knowledge in Python, specifically in:

* NumPy
    
* Pandas

* Matplotlib


## Repo architecture

* README.md -> Explains the project.
* requirements.txt -> Shows information on what libraries and oython version to install/use.
* main.py -> The main file that runs the program.
* shortcut.ipynb -> A shortcut to install and save the DSM & DTM in the correct way.


## Installation

`git clone` this repository into your local environment. 

Links to install the DSM and DTM:

* [Install DSM here](https://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dsm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DSM,%20raster,%201m)
* [Install DTM here](https://www.geopunt.be/download?container=dhm-vlaanderen-ii-dtm-raster-1m&title=Digitaal%20Hoogtemodel%20Vlaanderen%20II,%20DTM,%20raster,%201m)

The files need to be saved in chronological order,
an easy way of installing the files is by scraping them and saving them automatically using 
my code that you can find back in the shortcut.ipynb file.

In the requirements.txt file you can find all the necessary libraries to install and what python version to use.

## Usage

By running the main.py file you're able to run the entire program if the installation is done correctly, 
Give the program an address of a certain building you want to see the plot of and click enter. If your IDE is having issues running the program try running it on the command terminal.
After closing the first plot, a second plot will be shown, it's up to you wich one you prefer.

## Timeline

*October - November 2021*

- Duration: `2 weeks`
- Deadline: `04/11/21 17:00 PM`

## Personal situation
I'm currently participating in the [Becode.org AI Bootcamp](https://becode.org/learn/ai-bootcamp/) to upskill into a career in data science.
